* The application finds and displays the shortest path.
* The program uses the LOMBOK framework to reduce the code boilerplate.


Division into classes (described algorithm)
Vertex.java

The Vertex class represents a point in the coordinate system, it contains one method for calculating the distance between vertices.

1 public double measureDistanceBetweenVertices (final Vertex vertex) {
2 double ac = Math.abs (vertex.yAxis - this.getYAxis ());
3 double cb = Math.abs (vertex.xAxis - this.getXAxis ());
4
Return Math.hypot (ac, cb);
6}

The above method takes a different vertex as a parameter, in the second and third lines, the Math.abs () method returns the absolute value of a number. Takes a number as a parameter and returns the absolute value. This method returns a double, which is the result of the math function hypot (), which returns the Euclidean norm. This function returns sqrt (x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)

Route.java

The Route class represents a line, it includes:
-list of vertices as the only attribute,
- a constructor that takes a vertex list, which adds a vertex list from a parameter to a class attribute on object initialization,
-the method for calculating the total distance calculateTotalDistance ().

1 public double calculateTotalDistance () {
2 int verticesSize = this.getVertices (). Size ();
3 return (this.getVertices (). Stream ()
4 .mapToDouble (x -> {
5 int vertexIndex = this.getVertices (). IndexOf (x);
6 double returnValue = 0;
7 if (vertexIndex <verticesSize - 1) {
8 returnValue = x.measureDistanceBetweenVertices ((this.getVertices ()). Get (vertexIndex + 1));
9}
10 return returnValue;
11}). Sum ()); // + this.getVertices (). get (verticesSize - 12this.measureDistanceBetweenVertices (this.getVertices (). get (0)));
13}
In the second line, the variable verticesSize is initialized with the number of elements in the class's attribute. In the third line we open the data stream on an attribute of this class, in the fourth line the mapToDouble () stream method is called, which returns a DoubleStream consisting of the results of applying the given function (lines 5 to 10) to the elements of this stream. On line 5, the variable vertexIndex is initialized with the index number of the stream element 'x' of our class attribute. On line 6, another local variable, returnValue, is initialized, the value of which will change when the condition in line 7 is met. If the variable vertexIndex is less than verticesSize minus one, the distance between vertices 1 and 2, vertices 2 and 3, etc. is calculated. the total distance is summed by using the sum () function, which returns the sum of the elements in this stream. If there is a need to calculate the return route as well, uncomment part of lines 11 and 12 and remove ");" from behind the sum () function.

The NearestNeighbor.java class

The NearestNeighbor class represents an algorithm, has one initalIndex attribute representing the index of the "start" node, and three methods: findShortestRoute (), updateRoutes (), and getNextVertex ().

The findShortestRoute () method takes a list of vertices as its initial parameter.

1 public Route findShortestRoute (ArrayList <Vertex> vertices) {
2 ArrayList <Vertex> shortestRouteVertices = new ArrayList <> (vertices.size ());
3
4 System.out.println ("\ n ***************************************** ******** ");
5 System.out.println ("Initial route:" + Arrays.toString (vertices.toArray ()));
6 System.out.println ("Initial vertex:" + vertices.get (initialVertex));
7 System.out.println ("****************************************** ****** \ n ");
8
9 Vertex vertex = vertices.get (initialIndex);
10
11 updateRoutes (shortestRouteVertices, vertices, vertex);
12
13 while (vertices.size ()> = 1) {
14 vertex = getNextVertex (vertices, vertex);
15 updateRoutes (shortestRouteVertices, vertices, vertex);
16}
17
18 return new Route (shortestRouteVertices);
19}

In the second line of code, we declare and initialize the local variable shortestRouteVertices with a new array list containing the size of the vertices list passed in the (vertices) parameter in the primitive int type. Lines 4-7 are responsible for printing information about the starting path and the selected starting vertex on the console. In the ninth line we declare another local variable named vertex and initialize it with a vertex from the list passed in the method parameter with index from the initialIndex variable. On line 11, we call the updateRoutes () method that takes as parameters: a list containing the size of the vertex list, the initial vertex list, the starting node. It is responsible for removing the starting vertex from the list of passed starting vertices and adding it to the list of shortest vertices. Finally, it prints the vertices along the shortest route so far and the remaining vertices (method code below).

This was achieved by using the condition that if the size of the list (vertices) of initial vertices from the method parameter is not greater than or equal to one, then each time the vertex will be initialized using the getNextVertex () method [see below], then it will be called again updateRoutes () method. At the end of the findShortestRoute () method, a new Route object is returned with the shortest path list passed to the constructor.

In line 2 we open the data stream in the vertex list, in line 3 we use the min () method which returns the minimum stream element based on the given comparator. Then a simple comparator is presented, the local variable comparatorMark is initially declared and initialized with the value 0. This value is changed if one of the two conditions is met. If the distances between vertices (measureDistanceBetweenVertices () method described earlier): the first from the stream and given from the method parameter will be smaller than the second vertex from the stream and given from the method parameter, the value of the local variable will be -1, otherwise 1. Based on this comparator a vertex with a minimum distance from the test subject is selected.
